    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        India played its first Test match in 1932 at Lord's against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team">England</a>, becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. After initial struggles, India recorded its first Test victory in 1952 against England in Chennai. The 1970s saw the rise of legendary players like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar">Sunil Gavaskar</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapil_Dev">Kapil Dev</a>.See also: History of cricket in India to 1918
The British first brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721.[11] It was played and adopted by Kolis of Gujarat who were sea pirates and outlaws who often looted the British ships. The East India Company tried to manage the Kolis through cricket and were successful,[12][13][14] In 1848, the Parsi community in Mumbai formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877.[15] By 1912, the Parsis, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year.[15] In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the England cricket team. Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy – two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian men's cricket team, captained by Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team.
